## Preparation 
Please install the following python packages:

- Stable-baselines3 https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/install.html (Links to an external site.)
- pyglet https://github.com/pyglet/pyglet (Links to an external site.)

```sh
pip install stable-baselines3
pip install --upgrade --user pyglet
````

I highly recommend you to create a separate virtual python environment.
E.g., you can use python virtual envs with Anaconda (Links to an external site.).
